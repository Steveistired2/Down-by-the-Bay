# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.
Where silent water pass by
Watching the flow
I dare not leave
For if I do
The peace won't stay

The troubles of life
Will again be mine
